> This challenge is about writing shellcode in the BIOS.

We are given a BIOS image and a Floppy image. The BIOS image runs in QEMU and our task is to read the flag from the floppy. The floppy we are given contains a FAT FS and there is one file inside - **dummyflag** with a dummy flag **OOO{xxx...x}**, assuming that the real flag is on the real floppy in the server under **flag**.  
What can we do?  
We can give a shellcode which is under 2048 bytes and we are getting injected somewhere into the BIOS image before its execution.  

First things first, we would want to identify what BIOS is it and whether we can find some info on it. When starting the QEMU it gives us this message:  
> Welcome to (Sea)BIOOOSLESS (version v1337)

Looks like a modified version of the [open source SeaBIOS](https://github.com/qemu/seabios), which is great because we can compare it to the sources.  
The python script that runs the QEMU injects our shellcode in the binary where it can find 2048 'X's. First we need to know what the context is there - time for IDA.  
I had some problems opening the file in IDA at first, although there is a **bios_image.py** loader, and I couldn't get the mixture of 32bit code and 16bit code to coexist, so I ended up working with 2 open IDAs, one decompiled in 32bit mode, and one for 16bit. The 16bit code is not really relevant, so i worked mostly on the 32bit disassembly.  
For those unfamiliar with how a BIOS works, I'm not going to go everything here but basically there are 2 modes of execution at this level - [Real Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode) and [Protected Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode). In Real Mode the processor executes 16bit 8086 code and is very limited in resources. Protected Mode is 32bit code, can utilize much more memory. Both modes allow direct access to hardware using Ports, Interrupts and MMIO (contrary to Virtual Mode, where access to hardware is disallowed, and requires asking the OS for that purpose by using Syscalls or Software Interrupts.  
A x86 CPU starts its execution in Real Mode at the address `F000:FFF0` (See [Memory Segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation)), when the BIOS image is loaded at the address `F000:0000`. So that makes the entry point in offset `0xFFF0` in the BIOS image we are given. Note that code in that offset is 16bit.  
So we can open the file in IDA in 16bit loading it at segment `F000` and offset `0000`, or 32bit, loading it at offset `F0000 ((seg << 4) | offset)`.  
The 2048 'X's are in offset `0xF91E4`, which looks like the end of a very very long function. I converted the 'X's to '\x90's so they look like NOPs. First we should identify the long function and understand our context. There are some strings being used (like `Welcome to (Sea)BI...`) that we can match to different functions in the SeaBIOS source code (this one is probably at **bootsplash.c : enable_vga_console**. It looks like the huge function is just a mixture of many other (inline?) functions, but we can trace them back to **post.c : maininit**, which just calls these functions one after the other. So it makes sense that the compiler chose to inline them to save space and time. I managed to guess my way at the end of it, before the 'X's, to find **tcgbios.c : tpm_prepboot** at offset `0xF90CB to 0xF90F7`, then probably **malloc.c : malloc_prepboot** ending at `0xF91CB` and reaching the end of **post.c : prepareboot** at 0xF91DC, where the author placed a small delay loop and then the shellcode immediately.  
So right away we can see that the code is different from the original SeaBIOS - a lot of stuff is missing... like **make_bios_readonly**, the actual boot process, and more importantly to us - IVT initialization... But before this, we need to start debugging the code so we can see more easily what's going on.  
QEMU allows us to stop the CPU from starting execution until GDB is connected - flags **-s -S** and inside GDB: **target remote 127.0.0.1:1234**. There is no point to dive into the whole boot process, we just need to see what's happening when the shellcode is being executed. We can assemble a small shellcode that simply hangs:
```
bits 32
loop:
    jmp loop
```
Compile with `nasm shellcode.asm -o shellcode.bin` and use `shellcode.bin` as the input to the python loader. Then we can break after a couple of seconds of execution (Ctrl+C in GDB) and see what's happening. The first thing that comes to mind is that we stopped at the address `0x7fbd8a4` and not the expected `0xF91E4`... This is because the 32bit-only part of the BIOS is relocated to a higher segment. Some functions still remain in the `0xFXXXX` section, mostly the functions that are in use by interrupt handlers and common functions from the initial boot. What's important about this address is that it's **deterministic** so we can create a `.gdbinit` file and place `hb *0x7fbd8a4` inside it to always break when we reach the shellcode. Working with a **.gdbinit** file really saved me a ton of time here on repeating instructions.  
Ok so we know where we're executed, we know how and we can get all the information about the environment. Now we only need to understand what to write. The goal of the challenge is to read a file from floppy. Going a little into the code of SeaBIOS, we can see the usage of the floppy drive if we follow the boot sequence (`startBoot -> int 19h -> handle_19 -> ...`) - it seems that SeaBIOS is using INT 13h to talk to the floppy. Seems pretty easy usage, [INT 13h is highly documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_13H). Let's make sure it's available:
```
(gdb) x/100x 0
0x0:    0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x10:   0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x20:   0xf000e06e      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x30:   0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x40:   0xc000560e      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000  <- INT 13h "handler" :(
```
Nope... We only have
* INT 8h - address 0x20 in IVT - Timer - set in the mainint mega-function  
* INT 10h - address 0x40 in IVT - Video - didn't find where its being set  

Now the picture is getting clearer - we need to read the floppy without using built-in functions at all. In other words, we would have to talk to the hardware directly.  
At this point I dove deep into SeaBIOS code, trying to understand what is the first thing that the BIOS is even doing to the floppy. This led me to the **floppy_setup** function that reads the floppy device type. We can replicate that code in our shellcode to make sure we're not missing anything and that we can actually communicate with the floppy.  

`rtc_read(CMOS_FLOPPY_DRIVE_TYPE)` basically translates to
```
; outb(CMOS_FLOPPY_DRIVE_TYPE | NMI_DISABLE_BIT, PORT_CMOS_INDEX);
; type = inb(PORT_CMOS_DATA);

bits 32
    mov al, 0x90
    out 0x70, al
    in al, 0x71
```
**AL=0x40** which means `floppyid=0, ftype=4` - we can found this in the floppy description table in `floppy.c - // 4 - 1.44MB, 3.5" - 2 heads, 80 tracks, 18 sectors` - makes sense, we were given a 1.44MB image.  
So now that we have a POC of communicating with the floppy, we need to actually read the data. To do this I basically followed the code that is getting executed when the BIOS invokes `INT 13h AH=02h` - it contains everything that is needed to perform the first and subsequent reads. The main flow is something like that:  
```
disk_1302 ->
    basic_access ->
        send_disk_op ->
            # Note that we're in Real Mode, following an interrupt
            process_op -> process_op_16 ->floppy_process_op ->
                floppy_read ->
                    floppy_prep
                    floppy_dma_cmd
                    ...
```
We don't need to copy **A LOT** of code, so we can just go over the functions and copy them one by one into a single .c file - ugly, but works :)  
Not all the functions are needed fully. For example, from `basic_access` we can jump directly to `floppy_read`, etc.  
We can also get rid of different error checking code, such as
```
if (count > 128 || count == 0 || sector == 0) {
    warn_invalid(regs);
    disk_ret(regs, DISK_RET_EPARAM);
    return;
}
```
since we know what we're going to read in advance. All the `dprintf`s gotta go. This:
```
ret = floppy_media_sense(drive_gf);
if (ret)
    return ret;
```
can be omitted, since we know we have a disk in.  
One other thing that may give us trouble is the timers. Finding timer functions in the relocated code is annoying and including them in the shellcode is just bloated and unnecessary. However, we don't need the code to be fast and multi-threaded, so we can just convert all the timers into a regular busy sleep using RDTSC. That code actually exists in the SeaBIOS code, it uses two global variables: **ShiftTSC** that I found in `0xFDB82` and **TimerKHz** (`0xFDB88`):
```
static u32 timer_read(void)
{
    return rdtscll() >> *(u8*)(0xFDB82);
}

static u32 timer_calc(u32 msecs)
{
    return timer_read() + ((*(u32*)(0xFDB88)) * msecs);
}

static u32 timer_calc_usec(u32 usecs)
{
    u32 cur = timer_read(), khz = (*(u32*)(0xFDB88));
    if (usecs > 500000)
        return cur + DIV_ROUND_UP(usecs, 1000) * khz;
    return cur + DIV_ROUND_UP(usecs * khz, 1000);
}
```
Another annoyance that I found was `floppy_wait_irq` - we wait until we're interrupted by the floppy and the interrupt handler sets a global flag in memory. But we don't REALLY need to wait for the interrupt - we're only waiting for the floppy to finish processing our request, so we can assume that it will complete successfully, and under 1 millisecond. So that call can be replaced with `msleep(1);`  
The call to `getDrive(EXTTYPE_FLOPPY, extdrive)` can be omitted as well, since we already checked the device type and we can populate it by ourselves:
```
drive_fl.cntl_id = 0; //floppyid;
drive_fl.type = 0x10; //DTYPE_FLOPPY;
drive_fl.blksize = 512; //DISK_SECTOR_SIZE;
drive_fl.floppy_type = 4; //ftype;
drive_fl.sectors = (u64)-1;

// 4 - 1.44MB, 3.5" - 2 heads, 80 tracks, 18 sectors

drive_fl.lchs.head = 2;
drive_fl.lchs.cylinder = 80;
drive_fl.lchs.sector = 18;
```
The code uses some MACROs such as `GET_FARVAR`, `GET_BDA` etc. These can be copied under the assumption that `MODESEGMENT=0` since we are running in Protected Mode.  
Last thing, we need a global variable `FLOPPY_DOR_VAL`. We can just choose a random address for it, we know that `0xc0000 - 0x100000` is mapped, so I randomly chose `0xc9ff0` (was doing testing in `0xca000`)
```
#define FLOPPY_DOR_VAL (*(u32*)(0xc9ff0))
```
Compiling the code was a bit annoying, but after some trial and error I arrived at these flags:
```
gcc -m32 -Os -fomit-frame-pointer -Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch -fno-stack-protector -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -march=i386 -c read_floppy.c -o read_floppy.o
```
And finally, after some tweaking I managed to get the code to work and read the first sector into the 0x7c0 segment (it's the segment being used in the boot sequence):
```
struct bregs br;

memset(&br, 0, sizeof(br));
br.flags = F_IF;
br.dl = 0;      // drive
br.es = 0x7c0;  // segment
br.ah = 2;      // read command
br.al = 1;      // sectors to read
br.cl = 1;      // sector
```
Note that if this is successful, the memory will be written in address 0x7c00 (segment << 4).  
Now the only thing we need is to find the flag! We can parse the FAT partition, but we don't really need to, we can read multiple sectors and search for "OOO{". For some reason I missed the part that you can read multiple sectors at once, so I just made a loop that reads a single sector to address `0x7c00` and scans it for the beginning of the flag.  
Once the flag is found we only need to display it on the screen and we're done! The simplest solution will be to use the same function that the BIOS uses to display the "Welcome" string, but for some reason I didn't manage to get it to work, something would always break in the interrupt handler. I figured maybe the BIOS changed the VGA mode, so I decided to write directly to the VGA buffer (at address `0xb8000`) and surprisingly enough, this worked like a charm!
```
int i=0;
while(*flag){
    *(u16*)(0xb8000 + i) = (0x0F00) | *(flag++);
    i += 2;
}
```
Just a reminder, writing a byte to the VGA buffer takes 2 bytes, where the MSB is the color. 0x0F is "White on Black".
That's it! I was too lazy to write a python script that will communicate with the server and display the output, so just pasted the base64 encoded shellcode, and after a second:
```
OOO{dont_make_fun_of_noobs_that_cant_read_from_floppies_it_aint_that_easy}
```
This was super fun, I remembered some details about 8086 execution and Real/Proteted Modes, and this challenge was a good reminder and a good source of knowledge of things that I would have probably never seen otherwise :)
